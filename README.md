About
Intelligence Where You Get Your Next Music.
Rapid development of mobile devices and internet has made possible for us to access different music resources freely. The number of songs available exceeds the listening capacity of single individual. People sometimes feel difficult to choose from millions of songs. Moreover, music service providers need an efficient way to manage songs and help their customers to discover music by giving quality recommendation. Thus, there is a strong need of a good recommendation system. The Music Recommendation System will recommend users the type of music they want to listen. The recommendation will be based on what the user listens as per their previous music. It will be suggesting using various factors which are energy ,tempo ,acousticness, danceability , instrumentalness etc.
